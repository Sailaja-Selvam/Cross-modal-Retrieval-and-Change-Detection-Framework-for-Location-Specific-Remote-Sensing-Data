# Cross-modal-Retrieval-and-Change-Detection-Framework-for-Location-Specific-Remote-Sensing-Data

Retrieving satellite images using free-form natural language is a challenging and underdeveloped area in remote sensing.
Traditional cross-modal retrieval approaches often:
   Fail to capture the semantic richness of textual descriptions
Struggle with accurate alignment of visual and textual modalities, particularly in remote sensing
Complexity of Remote Sensing Data:
Satellite imagery includes diverse landforms, heterogeneous objects, and complex spatial layouts
Effective understanding requires:
High-level contextual 
Fine-grained spatial relationships
